A professor once told me “contracts are there for the bad times, not the good times”. Regulation, and legislation is the same. They are there for the bad times, when you most need it, not the good times, when its all honeymoon and champagne.
I now more than ever see the need, or even necessity for regulation, not as a mechanism to prevent, but as a mechanism to protect. Its like a child trying to stick their finger into a electric outlet, you stop them, before they can learn why they shouldn’t. One day they will understand, but not today.
