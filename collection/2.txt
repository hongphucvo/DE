I often feel that a lot of what is being built in crypto is being built by people that read a Wikipedia article on bonds, or seigniorage, or debt instruments and then thought to themselves, “they can do this better”.
Its something that happens often in coding, you find a fresh piece of code written by another organization or developer, you quickly start finding faults, “this isn’t needed”, “this could have been done better”, “why did they do this? its pointless”, and then starts the “I can do this better”. So you spend the next few days, weeks, even months re-engineering the code, then you hit your first wall, and you have to make some adjustments, then your second, then your third and so on, and eventually your code looks exactly like their code did, and you have that “oh, right, that’s why” moment as you finally understand why it was what it was.
